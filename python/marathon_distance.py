25-Mile Marathon

Mary wants to run a 25-mile marathon. When she
attempts to sign up for the marathon, she notices
the sign-up sheet doesn't directly state the
marathon's length. Instead, the marathon's length
is listed in small, different portions.
Help Mary find out how long the marathon actually is.

Return True if the marathon is 25 miles long, otherwise, return False.

Examples:
marathon_distance([1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False
marathon_distance([1, 9, 5, 8, 2]) ➞ True
marathon_distance([-6, 15, 4]) ➞ True

Notes:
Items in the list will always be integers.
Items in the list may be negative or positive,
    but since negative distance isn't possible,
    find a way to convert the sum of the distance
    into a positive integer.
Return False if the arguments are empty or not provided.
