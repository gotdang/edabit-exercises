"""
Repeating Letters

Create a function that takes a string and returns a
string in which each character is repeated once.

Examples:
double_char("String") ➞ "SSttrriinngg"
double_char("Hello World!") ➞ "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd!!"
double_char("1234!_ ") ➞ "11223344!!__  "

Notes:
All test cases contain valid strings.
Don't worry about spaces, special characters or numbers.
They're all considered valid characters.
